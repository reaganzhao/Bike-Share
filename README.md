# Bike-Share
The dataset is from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/sf-bay-area-bike-share, around 10 GB in total. We did all the data processing, model application and visualization on AWS.

Our goal is to understand how features such as weather conditions affect trip duration and build models to predict trip durations based on bikeshare data.We tested regression models from Spark ML Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Regularized Linear Regression and got the final RMSE = 561.

Thanks to Prof. [Diane Woodbridge](https://github.com/dianewoodbridge) for her guidance and support on this school project. Also, thanks to my teammates Vivian Chu, Arthur Qin, Todd Zhang and Yao Liu for their contribution.
